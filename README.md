---------------------------
-
-How to run the program:
-
- 1) Open main.rkt
- 2) Hit run
- 3) enter an artist to search and hit "Submit". (Note: Pressing the "Enter/Return" key does nothing.)
- 4) wait for results to show.
- 5) double-click the most appropriate result.
- 6) wait
- 7) click through each result to view album art, if any is available.
- -double click on a result to open up youtube on the default browser with your result as a search-query
- 8) single-click on a result and then hit "suggested results" on the bottom of the window to view recommended alternatives to the selected result
- 9) wait
- 10) *see number 7*
-
- 11) close the windows and try a new search!

---------------------------
-
-Structure of the code:
-
- The overall structure of the code is fairly well separated.
-main.rkt contains all of the GUI elements while parsing.rkt contains
-all of the flatfile-parsing and network elements.
-
- The gui code constructs various classes of smaller objects which
-are assembled together through a larger frame class. Each of the smaller classes
-have a specific role and are generally abstracted from one another. The primary
-function of the GUI is to create a user-friendly interface for all of the data
-that is being fed by the code in parsing.rkt.
-
- parsing.rkt is where all of the magic happens, so to speak. It is here
-that xml and htm' information gets pulled from public domain databases and parsed in series
-of nested lists before it is passed to the gui classes in main.rkt for presentation.
-
---------------------------
-
-Work that I did:
-
- The file that I did the most work in is main.rkt. I constructed most of
-the GUI framework to use Derek's pulled information from the databases. Derek
-edited some things in it once we were integrating our code, but those were mostly
-for compatability purposes.
-
-The things that I wrote, which most pertain to the ideas of the class were:
-
---in main.rkt--
-
-- Data abstraction and object oriented programming
-
- Most of the gui elements follow this schema so I will not point
-out every instance that exists within the code. However, once example includes
-the relationship between the netimage% class on line 37 and the the results-window%
-class defined on line 302. results-window% is a class that contains a netimae% within
-it, but does not have any direct access to its elements. As a result, it must use
-"send" procedures to netimage% for any alterations of information, with hopes that
-netimage% contains such methods. Otherwise, results-window% is unable to change
-netimage% directly.
-
--lets and lambdas
-
- Also another topic that is used throughout the gui. lets and lambdas were
-necessary for dealing with the gui, as small locally defined functions were practically
-required for the specific actions that they required only within the contexts of their
-definitions. For example, within the on-paint method of netimage% on line 60,
-a let procedure is used to draw images onto a given canvas. The procedure decides
-which canvas is requested to draw into and handles the call appropriately.
-
--lists
-
- lists are used to store all of our data.
-
-
---in parsing.rkt--
-
--foldr
-
- Although it is a minor procedure, and only one of them exist beginning
-in line 112, it was vital to our efforts in parsing parts of the xml flatfiles.
-This foldr finds an '&' symbol within a list and combines it with the strings
-of the next and previous cars of the list, turning three cons cells into one.
-This was necessary because the xml files would separate strings containing an
-'&' symbol into 3 separate parts, so we had to paste them back together.
